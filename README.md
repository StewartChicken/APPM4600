This repository contains work from CU Boulder's APPM 4600, Numerical Methods and Scientific Computing course. 
There are two subdirectories: the Homeworks directory and the Labs directory. The Homeworks directory will contain
code and files relevant to specific homework assignments throughout the semester. The Labs directory will
contain code and files relevant to the weekly labs which are completed every Thursday. A combination of Python
and LaTeX will be used to create the various documents and resources utilized throughout the semester.
